# 📄 J.P. Morgan Classification for Legal Documents

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Automate the classification of various legal documents to improve efficiency and reduce errors in the legal review process.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- 🔄 Convert a business problem into an analytical problem
- 📊 Break down the process using CRISP-DM methodology
- 🚀 Apply data mining techniques to legal document classification

## 📘 Project Overview
This project implements an automated system for classifying legal documents at J.P. Morgan using the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology. The solution replaces manual document review processes with a systematic, data-driven approach to improve accuracy and speed.

## 🔍 Understanding the Problem
We approach this challenge systematically by:
- 📋 Categorizing the data to understand its nature
- 🧩 Analyzing the four pillars of CRISP-DM analytics to structure the solution
- 🔄 Breaking down the problem into the six stages of CRISP-DM

## 📑 Data Categorization
While no specific dataset is provided, we identify potential categories of data:

- 💬 **Attitudinal Data**: Analyze sentiment or tone within the text (e.g., neutral, positive, or negative)
- 📱 **Behavioral Data**: Examine metadata such as document location, modifications, or similar attributes
- 👥 **Demographic Data**: Classify legal documents by type, client details, or other relevant demographics

## 🏛️ Four Pillars of CRISP-DM Analytics

### 📊 Descriptive Analytics
- Understand data patterns and derive insights
- Analyze document structure, volume, and outliers
- Visualize data using tools like word clouds or graphs

### 🔬 Diagnostic Analytics
- Identify issues in manual reviews
- Investigate unusual patterns or errors

### 🔮 Predictive Analytics
- Evaluate techniques for document classification
- Assess limitations and select the best approach

### 💡 Prescriptive Analytics
- Define the process for implementation
- Recommend standard templates to reduce errors
- Suggest future strategies for improvement
